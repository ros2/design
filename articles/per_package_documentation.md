## Background

ROS 2 is lacking a process for the conglomeration of package documentation.
Discoverability for package documentation (and documentation in general) is one of the most frequent user complaints.

The goal of this design is to standardize a documentation process for ROS 2 packages to encourage maintainers to robustly document their packages.
The results will be presented in a consistent way alongside the general ROS 2 documentation, making the documentation as a whole discoverable and consistent.

In general, the vision for the system is:

- Package maintainers document their packages in their repositories following some recommended guidelines or templates
- Package documentation (API documentation, other package related content) from the repositories is built on the ROS 2 infrastructure and deployed to the ROS 2 documentation site in an automatic process maintainers can opt in to by adding a `doc` block to the `distribution.yaml`
  - See [REP 141](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0141.html) for more context.
- Package documentation is indexed alongside ROS 2's generic content on the docs site

## Context

The per-package documentation plan is an extension of the general ROS 2 documentation project, which introduced some requirements that affect the context of the per-package documentation:

- All documentation will be hosted on `docs.ros.org`
- All documentation will be versioned by ROS 2 distribution names
- The URL structure will be `docs.ros.org/<lang>/<distro>/...` for generic documentation and `docs.ros.org/<lang>/<distro>/p/<package_name>/...` for package documentation
  - See the diagram below for more context on where documentation will fall under this URL structure:

## Requirements

The "Primary requirements" are those that must be in place for the system to be functional and achieve its purpose.
The "Secondary requirements" are also absolute requirements, however they are not necessary to roll out the first stage of implementation.
They will be carried out as soon as possible following the initial roll out.

### Primary requirements

**All package documentation must be available with the rest of the ROS 2 documentation under a single domain**

Package documentation will be treated the same as the generic ROS 2 documentation.
Its presence as part of the docs site should be made well-known from the site's overview as well as from any entry point into the docs site, and be intuitive from the organization and layout of the site.

**Package documentation must have an easily navigable and intuitive URL structure**

Every package's "home page" should be reachable with minimal effort by the scheme `docs.ros.org/p/<package_name>/`, which will redirect to default language and version, `docs.ros.org/<lang>/<distro>/p/<package_name>/`  

**Package documentation must be maintainable in its repository without going through a third party**

Maintainers and contributors will only have to work on their package's documentation within its repository.
The details of building and hosting will not be a concern of package maintainers.

Despite being hosted alongside the generic documentation, working on a package's documentation will not require any work on the repositories of the generic documentation (currently `ros2/ros2_documentation`) or the site repository (currently `ros-infrastructure/rosindex`).

**The system must support C++ and Python API docs generation**

The system will automatically extract API docs for these languages from the source code in package repositories and build the output on the docs site.

**Package documentation must be written and formatted in rst (reStructuredText)**

Rst is the file format currently utilized by the ROS 2 documentation.
Package documentation should continue to utilize rst for consistency.

**The system must allow package documentation to be versioned per ROS 2 distribution**

The docs site and buildfarm will allow documentation for the latest version of a package corresponding to each ROS 2 distribution the docs site supports versioning for.
The package repository can still maintain it's own docs for previous versions.

While multiple package versions per distribution will not initially be supported, the URL structure will support the addition of this feature in the future (mentioned under "Secondary requirements" below).

**The buildfarm must automatically build package documentation**

Changes to the documentation in a package repository shouldn't require the maintainer to manually trigger a build.
The changes should be automatically built and uploaded to the site.

**The system must automatically generate listing content for a package so it's listed on docs.ros.org even if the package maintainer does not explicitly set up anything in the package repository**

Maintainers can explicitly opt out of being listed, but otherwise by default some package info will be listed for every available package.

**The systems must support cross-referencing between packages**

A stable linking process will be in place to cross-reference between package docs despite their originating from separate repositories.

**The system must prevent the possibility of package file names (created by maintainers) colliding with auto-generated content (from the system's side)**

When writing package documentation, maintainers should not have to concern themselves with auto-generated content, like the current `/changelogs` and `/symbols` directories in the current `docs.ros.org` API docs structure for ROS 1.

### Secondary requirements

**Package maintainers should have the ability to include free form documentation, like tutorials, design docs, etc., alongside generated API docs on docs.ros.org**

**The system should provide a standardized interface for generating an index page/landing page for packages, consistent across ROS 2**

**The system should provide a standardized method for generating package documentation locally, including build error alerts**

**The system should be extensible for more languages**

**Users should be able to switch between versions (distributions) while viewing a package's documentation**

**docs.ros.org/p/ should present a table of contents listing all packages with documentation**

**The system should support building documentation for more than one version of a package per ROS 2 distribution**
