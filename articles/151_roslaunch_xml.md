# ROS 2 Launch XML Format v0.1.0

## Rationale

As an alternative to a programmatic approach to the ROS 2 launch system's API, a declarative description features a WYSIWYG approach, easier to read, audit and maintain.
This is the preferred approach for ROS 1 `roslaunch` launch files, thus some degree of familiarity is expected (and relied upon).

The body of such a description is mainly comprised of statically declared launch actions with a prescribed configuration.
To that, runtime value substitution is added in order to fullfill common dynamic (re)configuration needs like conditional execution, resource lookups, etc.
It is intended for these entities to map to those of the underlying implementation, reducing support to file parsing.

This article describes XML aiming to ease the bridge between ROS and ROS 2 launch files.
YAML is currently supported too, and other markup languages could be added.

## Static Description

### Schema Definition

```xml
{% include_relative specs/launch.0.1.1.xsd %}
```

### Tags Semantics

#### All Tags

Every tag's execution can be conditioned on a boolean predicate via `if` or `unless` attributes.

#### `<launch>` Tag

Root tag of any launch file.
There must only be one `<launch>` tag on a given launch file.

#### `<include>` Tag

##### Description

The `<include>` tag allows for bringing a launch file description into another, enabling re-use of hierarchical launch layouts.
The included launch file description has its own scope for launch configurations.
The included launch file description is not necessarily written in this format nor a declarative one (i.e. a programmatic description).

##### Examples

```xml
<include file="/opt/my_launch_file.py"/>
<include file="$(find-pkg-share my_pkg)/launch/some_launch_file.xml"/>
<include file="/opt/my_other_launch_file.xml">
  <arg name="some_argument" value="dummy_value"/>
</include>
```

#### `<group>` Tag

##### Description

The `<group>` tag allows for launch actions' grouping as well as optional launch file configuration scoping.

##### Examples

```xml
<group scoped="true">
  <node pkg="a_ros_package" name="dummy0" ns="my_ns" exec="dummy_node"/>
  <node pkg="a_ros_package" name="dummy1" exec="dummy_node"/>
</group>
```

#### `<let>` Tag

##### Description

The `<let>` tags allows for definition of scoped launch file configuration variables.

##### Examples

```xml
<let name="foo" value="$(env BAR)"/>
<let name="baz" value="false"/>
```

#### `<arg>` Tag

##### Description

The `<arg>` tag allows for launch file configuration via the command-line or when including it via an `<include>` tag.
Arguments are launch configuration variables just like the ones defined by `<let>` tags.
Arguments are limited to the scope of their definition and thus have to be explictly passed to included files if any.

##### Examples

```xml
<arg name="publish_frequency" default="10"/>
<arg name="output_path" description="Output path for some processing pipeline"/>
```

#### `<executable>` Tag

##### Description

The `<executable>` tag allows for executing any executable as a local OS process.

##### Examples

```xml
<executable cmd="ls -las" cwd="/home" launch-prefix="time" output="screen"/>
```

#### `<node>` Tag

##### Description

The `<node>` tag allows for executing a ROS node as a local OS process.

##### Examples

```xml
<node pkg="ros_demos" exec="publisher">
  <param name="publish_frequency" value="10"/>
  <remap from="generic_topic_name" to="my_topic"/>
</node>
```

#### `<param>` Tag

##### Description

The `<param>` tag allows for setting ROS parameters of a ROS node.
These can be scalar values or sequences of scalar values, defined directly or
either nested or brought from a YAML file to make a map.

##### Examples

```xml
<node pkg="my_pkg" exec="my_node">
  <param name="some_numeric_param" value="100.2"/>
  <param name="some_list_of_bools" value="[true, false, true, false]"/>
  <param name="some_list_of_strings" value="Some phrase,'100.0','true'" value-sep=","/>
  <param name="some_list_of_ints" value="5, 3, 2" value-sep=", "/>
  <param name="some_list_of_floats" value="5.0, 3.0, 2.0" value-sep=", "/>
  <param name="some_param_group">
    <param name="some_integer_param" value="10"/>
  </param>
  <param from="path/to/param/file.yml"/>
</node>
```

#### `<remap>` Tag

##### Description

The `<remap>` tag allows for ROS name remapping of a `<node>` instance.

##### Examples

```xml
<node pkg="my_pkg" exec="my_node">
  <remap from="chatter" to="/my_chatter"/>
  <remap from="*/stuff" to="private_\1/stuff"/>
</node>
```

#### `<env>` Tag

##### Description

The `<env>` tag allows for modifying an OS process environment.
It can be used nested in `node` or `executable` tags.
It doesn't allow conditional execution.

##### Examples

```xml
<node pkg="my_pkg" exec="my_node">
  <env name="RMW_IMPLEMENTATION" value="rmw_fastrtps_cpp"/>
</node>

<executable cmd="ls" cwd="/var/log">
  <env name="LD_LIBRARY" value="/lib/some.so"/>
</executable>
```

#### `<set_env>` Tag

##### Description

The `<set_env>` tag allows for modifying an OS process environment.
It can be used nested in `launch` or `group` tags.
It allows conditional execution.

##### Examples

```xml
<group>
  <set_env name="RMW_IMPLEMENTATION" value="rmw_fastrtps_cpp"/>
</group>
```

#### `<unset_env>` Tag

##### Description

The `<unset_env>` tag allows for deleting an OS process environment variable.
It can be used nested in `launch` or `group` tags.
It allows conditional execution.

##### Examples

```xml
<group>
  <unset_env name="MY_ENV_VAR"/>
</group>
```

## Dynamic Configuration

### Substitution Syntax

All substitutions are enclosed by `$(...)`.

### Built-in Substitutions

`$(find-pkg-prefix <pkg-name>)`
: Substituted by the install prefix path of the given package.
  Forward and backwards slashes will be resolved to the local filesystem convention.
  Substitution will fail if the package cannot be found.

`$(find-pkg-share <pkg-name>)`
: Substituted by the share directory path of the given package.
  The share directory includes the package's name, e.g. `<prefix>/share/<pkg-name>`.
  Forward and backwards slashes will be resolved to the local filesystem convention.
  Substitution will fail if the package cannot be found.

`$(find-exec <exec-name>)`
: Substituted by the path to the executable in the local filesystem.
  Executables are looked up in the PATH environment variable.
  Forward and backwards slashes will be resolved to the local filesystem convention.
  Substitution will fail if the executable cannot be found.

`$(exec-in-package <exec-name> <package-name>)`
: Substituted by the path to the executable in the local filesystem.
  Executables are looked up in the `lib` directory of the package.
  Substitution will fail if the executable cannot be found.

`$(var <name>)`
: Substituted by the value of the launch configuration variable.
  Substitution will fail if the named argument does not exist.

`$(env <env-var> [default-value])`
: Substituted by the value of the given environment variable
  Substitution will fail if the variable is not set, unless a default value is provided.

`$(eval <python-expression>)`
: Substituted by the evaluated python expression.
  Substitution will fail if python fails to evaluate the expression.

`$(dirname)`
: Substituted by the current launch file directory name.
  Substitution will always succeed.

#### User-defined Substitutions
