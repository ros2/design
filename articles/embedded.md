While standard ROS 2 can run on Linux-class embedded devices, smaller microcontrollers (MCU) are still a challenge. For example, ARM Cortex-M3 and -M4 class MCUs are popular for motion control and sensor integration, but have little RAM and storage. ARM Cortex-M3 is widely used in many sensors due to its optimized power consumption capabilities and ultra low power modes. These microcontrollers are often running with small batteries, e.g. for environmental sensors or small consumer robots, which requires efficient power management. We aim to address these devices through a combination of specialized, ROS 2-interoperable stack as well as the use of small Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS).

This article documents requirements, design ideas and related works on this undertaking.

## Wishlist

A number of things that would be great to have, lets call it a wishlist... Feel free to add stuff ;-)

| Key | Title | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| W-SEAMLESS | **Seamless integration with ROS&nbsp;2** | The embedded ROS 2 stack shall integrate seamlessly with standard ROS 2 stacks and nodes running on stronger microprocessors. For a standard ROS 2 node, communication (topics, services) from and to software running on the embedded ROS 2 stack should be transparent. The same should hold for other core concepts such as parameters, graph introspection, and run-time reconfiguration by the node lifecycle.|
| W-PORTABILITY | **Portability of ROS 2-based software** | The embedded ROS 2 stack shall resemble or directly use the ROS 2 API -- more precisely the rclcpp API -- to facilitate porting standard ROS 2 nodes to MCUs. |
| W-DEVICES | **Support of a broad spectrum of device classes** | The embedded ROS 2 stack shall support a broad range of MCU device classes, starting from a few tens kilobyte of RAM. This implies suitable abstractions to be able to adapt the stack to specific hardware features/mechanisms as well as to replace modules or layers with optimized implementations.|
| W-RTOS | **Support of a broad spectrum of RTOS(s)** | Similarly, the stack shall be adaptable to different RTOS (e.g., NuttX, FreeRTOS, Zephyr) and provide abstractions with regard to the application software to facilitate porting application components to between RTOSs.|
| W-MW | **Support of prevalent communication technologies** | To cover the broad range of use-cases for MCUs in robotics, the embedded ROS 2 stack shall be usable with the default ROS 2 middleware standard DDS, simple (custom) serial communication protocols just as common wireless technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy |
| W-MODULARITY | **High Modularity** | The embedded ROS 2 stack shall be highly modular, not only to allow for adaptation to specific hardware features and different RTOS, but also to allow the integration with existing frameworks and to be able to create customized sub-stacks. For example, it shall be usable in the style of rosserial, thus bringing basically the message serialization to the MCU only. Similarly, it should be possible to derive a sub-stack that provides node graph features and publish/subscribe but no parameters and services, and so on.
| W-CONTROL | **Support control-oriented applications**  | MCUs are great for control, and micro-ROS should be as well. This usually means hard real-time performance with low jitter and small response times. |
| W-MCU-SPEC | **MCU-specific core functionalities and mechanisms** | Finally, the embedded ROS 2 stack shall include novel core functionalities and mechanisms that are specific for MCUs. These include power management functionalities and mechanisms for static initialization and memory management.|

In the EU project OFERA, we compiled a longer list of requirements to an embedded ROS 2 stack, which might serve as a good basis for the discussion. Please see Section 5 in [ofera.eu/deliverables/D1.7_Requirements.pdf](http://ofera.eu/deliverables/D1.7_Requirements.pdf).

## Questions

To determine how feasible that is, and to come up with the actual requirements and/or design, a few questions come to mind. I've cross-referenced them to the relevant wishlist items (most of the there's more than one -- this suggests areas where trade-offs may be required, or alternatives pursued).

| Key | Related Wish | Question |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| Q-RTOS | W-RTOS, W-PORTABILITY | Which RTOS(s) do we use as the basis? |
| Q-BUILD | W-RTOS, W-PORTABILITY | How do we handle the RTOS(s) respective build-systems? |
| Q-LANG | W-PORTABILITY | Which language should be used, and at what spec level? |
| Q-API | W-PORTABILITY, W-MODULARITY | How should the API look in general?|
| Q-PERF | W-PORTABILITY, W-DEVICES, W-CONTROL | What are the performance implications of the API?|
| Q-MIDDLEWARE | W-MW | Which communication/middleware technology is used?|
| Q-MCU-SPEC | W-DEVICES, W-MCU-SPEC, W-CONTROL | Which MCU-specific features do we offer in the external API?|

## Actions

> *TODO: Maybe don't call this action, but "fact finding" or the like?*

To answer these questions, both the OFERA EU project as well as several others have already undertaken or are planning exploratory work.

*Meta-Note*: Please only add a short description here, linking to more detailed pages if necessary.

| Key | Related Question | Action | Description | Links |
|-----|------------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| A-RTOS | Q-RTOS | RTOS Proof-of-Concept | Provide a proof-of-concept RTOS. In the OFERA project, we chose NuttX, because it is largely POSIX compatible and thus eases porting. There are also experiments based on RIOT and FreeRTOS | TODO |
| A-BUILD-META | Q-BUILD | Meta-Build | Explores a meta-build approach to transform ROS 2 CMakeLists.txt to RTOS-specific build instructions. | TODO |
| A-BUILD-NUTTX | Q-BUILD | NuttX-specific build | OFERA has integrated (parts of) micro-ROS directly as an app in the NuttX build. |TODO |
| A-BUILD-ANDROID | Q-BUILD | Arduino Build | Robotis has explored building all the libraries using the Arduino IDE. This required some manual changes and thus does not scale, but can get you off the ground. | TODO |
| A-NUTTX-LIBCXX | Q-LANG | C++11/higher support for NuttX | Build libxx from the LLVM project on NuttX, as a pre-requisite to building rclcpp. | TODO |
| A-PERF-RCLCPP-RESOURCE | Q-PERF | Determine resource use of rclcpp | |  TODO |


## Prior and on-going works

### ROS2-based approaches
*   [EU project OFERA](http://ofera.eu/): The EU project OFERA (Open Framework for Embedded Robot Applications) aims at a ROS 2-compatible stack for MCUs in the range of STM32F4 or STM32L1, i.e. with possibly less than 100kB RAM. The project partners currently investigate of using the ROS 2 rmw, rcl and rclcpp layers as-is on the micro-XRCE-DDS implementation of the upcoming XRCE-DDS standard. In parallel, a more modular approach in the style of rosserial is investigated. In the project's use-cases, NuttX is considered as primary choice for the RTOS. Beyond the project page, additional details of the project results can be found at [http://micro-ros.com](http://micro-ros.com).
