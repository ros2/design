## Document Scope

This document describes potential threats for ROS 2 robotic systems.
The document is divided into two parts:

1. Robotic Systems Threats Overview
1. Threat Analysis for the TurtleBot 3 Robotic Platform
1. Threat Analysis for the MARA Robotic Platform

The first section lists and describes threats from a theoretical point of view.
Explanations in this section should hold for any robot built using a
component-oriented architecture.
The second section instantiates those threats on a widely-available reference platform, the
TurtleBot 3.
Mitigating threats on this platform enables us to demonstrate the viability of our recommendations.

## Robotic Systems Threats Overview

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
This section is intentionally independent from ROS as robotic systems
share common threats and potential vulnerabilities.
For instance, this section describes "robotic components" while the next section will mention
"ROS 2 nodes".
</div>

### Defining Robotic Systems Threats

We will consider as a robotic system one or more general-purpose computers
connected to one or more actuators or sensors.
An actuator is defined as any device producing physical motion.
A sensor is defined as any device capturing or recording a physical property.

### Robot Application Actors, Assets, and Entry Points

This section defines actors, assets, and entry points for this threat model.

**Actors** are humans or external systems interacting with the robot.
Considering which actors interact with the robot is helpful to determine how the system
can be compromised.
For instance, actors may be able to give commands to the robot which may be abused to attack the
system.

**Assets** represent any user, resource (e.g. disk space), or property (e.g. physical
safety of users) of the system that should be defended against attackers.
Properties of assets can be related to acheiving the business goals of the robot.
For example, sensor data is a resource/asset of the system and the privacy of that
data is a system property and a business goal.

**Entry points** represent how the system is interacting with the world (communication
channels, API, sensors, etc.).

#### Robot Application Actors

Actors are divided into multiple categories based on whether or not they are
physically present next to the robot (could the robot harm them?), are they
human or not and are they a "power user" or not.
A power user is defined as someone who is knowledgeable and execute tasks which are normally
not done by end-users (build and debug new software, deploy code, etc.).

#### Assets

Assets are categorized in privacy (robot private data should not
be accessible by attackers), integrity (robot behavior should not be modified
by attacks) and availability (robot should continue to operate even under
attack).

### Robot Application Components and Trust Boundaries

The system is divided into hardware (embedded general-purpose computer,
sensors, actuators), multiple components
(usually processes) running on multiple computers (trusted or non-trusted
components) and data stores (embedded or in the cloud).

While the computers may run well-controlled, trusted software (trusted
components), other off-the-shelf robotics components (non-trusted) nodes may be
included in the application.
Third-party components may be malicious (extract private data, install a root-kit, etc.) or their
QA validation process may not be as extensive as in-house software.
Third-party components releasing process create additional security threats (third-party component
may be compromised during their distribution).

A trusted robotic component is defined as a node developed, built, tested and
deployed by the robotic application owner or vetted partners.
As the process is owned end-to-end by a single organization, we can assume that the node will
respect its specifications and will not, for instance, try to extract and leak private information.
While carefully controlled engineering processes can reduce the risk of malicious behavior
(accidentally or voluntarily), it cannot completely eliminate it.
Trusted nodes can still leak private data, etc.

Trusted nodes should not trust non-trusted nodes.
It is likely that more than one non-trusted component is embedded in any given robotic application.
It is important for non-trusted components to not trust each other as one malicious non-trusted
node may try to compromise another non-trusted node.

An example of a trusted component could be an in-house (or carefully vetted) IMU
driver node.
This component may communicate through unsafe channels with other
driver nodes to reduce sensor data fusion latency.
Trusting components is never ideal but it may be acceptable if the software is well-controlled.

On the opposite, an non-trusted node can be a third-party object tracker.
Deploying this node without adequate sandboxing could impact:

* User privacy: the node is streaming back user video without their consent
* User safety: the robot is following the object detected by the tracker and its
  speed is proportional to the object distance.
  The malicious tracker estimates
  the object position very far away on purpose to trick the robot into suddenly
  accelerating and hurting the user.
* System availability: the node may try to consume all available computing
  resources (CPU, memory, disk) and prevent the robot from performing correctly.
* System Integrity: the robot is following the object detected by the tracker.
  The attacker can tele-operate the robot by controlling the estimated position
  of the tracked object (detect an object on the left to make the robot move to
  the left, etc.).

Nodes may also communicate with the local filesystem, cloud services or data stores.
Those services or data stores can be compromised and should not be automatically trusted.
For instance, URDF robot models are usually stored in the robot file system.
This model stores robot joint limits.
If the robot file system is compromised, those limits could be removed which would enable an
attacker to destroy the robot.

Finally, users may try to rely on sensors to inject malicious data into the
system ([Akhtar, Naveed, and Ajmal Mian. “Threat of Adversarial Attacks on
Deep Learning in Computer Vision: A Survey.”][akhtar_threat_2018]).

The diagram below illustrates an example application with different trust zones
(trust boundaries showed with dashed green lines).
The number and scope of trust zones is depending on the application.

### Threat Analysis and Modeling

The table below lists all *generic* threats which may impact a
robotic application.

Threat categorization is based on the [STRIDE][wikipedia_stride]
 (Spoofing / Tampering / Repudiation / Integrity / Denial of service
 / Elevation of privileges) model.
Risk assessment relies on [DREAD][wikipedia_dread] (Damage / Reproducibility /
 Exploitability / Affected users / Discoverability).

In the following table, the "Threat Category (STRIDE)" columns indicate the categories to which a
threat belongs.
If the "Spoofing" column is marked with a check sign (✓), it means that this threat can be used to
spoof a component of the system.
If it cannot be used to spoof a component, a cross sign will be present instead (✘).

The "Threat Risk Assessment (DREAD)" columns contain a score indicating how easy or likely it is
for a particular threat to be exploited.
The allowed score values are 1 (not at risk), 2 (may be at risk) or 3 (at risk, needs to
be mitigated).
For instance, in the damage column a 1 would mean "exploitation of the threat would cause minimum
damages", 2 "exploitation of the threat would cause significant damages" and 3 "exploitation of
the threat would cause massive damages".
The "total score" is computed by adding the score of each column.
The higher the score, the more critical the threat.

Impacted assets, entry points and business goals columns indicate whether an asset, entry point or
business goal is impacted by a given threat.
A check sign (✓) means impacted, a cross sign (✘) means not impacted.
A triangle (▲) means "impacted indirectly or under certain conditions".
For instance, compromising the robot kernel may not be enough to steal user data but it makes
stealing data much easier.

### Including a new robot into the threat model

The following steps are recommended in order to extend this document with additional threat models:

1. Determine the robot evaluation scenario.
   This will include:
  * System description and specifications
  * Data assets
1. Define the robot environment:
  * External actors
  * Entry points
  * Use cases
1. Design security boundary and architectural schemas for the robotic application.
1. Evaluate and prioritize entry points
  * Make use of the RSF[rsf] to find applicable weaknessess on the robot.
  * Take existing documentation as help for finding applicable entry points.
1. Evaluate existing threats based on general threat table and add new ones to the specific threat
   table.
  * Evaluate new threats with DREAD[wikipedia_dread] and STRIDE[wikipedia_stride] methodologies.
1. Design hypothetical attack trees for each of the entry points, detailing the affected resources
   on the process.
1. Create a Pull Request and submit the changes to the ros2/design repository.

## Threat Analysis for the `TurtleBot 3` Robotic Platform

### System description

The application considered in this section is tele-operation of a Turtlebot 3 robot using an Xbox
controller.

The robot considered in this section is a [TurtleBot 3 Burger][tb3_burger].
It is a small educational robot embedding an IMU and a Lidar, two motors /
wheels, and a chassis that hosts a battery, a Pi Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ Single
Board Computer, and a OpenCR 1.0 Arduino compatible board that interacts with the sensors.
The robot computer runs two nodes:

* [`turtlebot3_node`][turtlebot3_node] forwarding sensor data and actuator control commands,
* [`raspicam2_node`][raspicam2_node] which is forwarding camera data

We also make the assumption that the robot is running a ROS 2 port of the AWS
[CloudWatch sample application][cw_sample_app]).
A ROS 2 version of this component is not yet available, but it will help us demonstrate the threats
related to connecting a robot to a cloud service.

For the purpose of demonstrating the threats associated with distributing a ROS
graph among multiple hosts, an Xbox controller is connected to a secondary
computer (“remote host”).
The secondary computer runs two additional nodes:

* [`joy_node`][joy_node] is forwarding joystick input as ROS 2 messages,
* [`teleop_twist_joy`][teleop_twist_joy] is converting ROS 2 joystick messages to control commands.

Finally, the robot data is accessed by a test engineer through a “field testing” computer.

#### Assets

##### Hardware

* [TurtleBot 3 Burger][tb3_burger] is a small, [ROS-enabled][ros_wiki_tb]
  robot for education purposes.
  * Compute resources
    * Raspberry PI 3 host: OS Raspbian Stretch with ROS 2 Crystal running
      natively (without Docker), running as root.
    * OpenCR board: using ROS 2 firmware as described in the TurtleBot3 ROS 2 setup instructions.
  * [Hardware components][tb3_burger]) include:
    * The Lidar is connected to the Raspberry PI through USB.
    * A Raspberry PI camera module is connected to the Raspberry PI 3
      through its Camera Serial Interface (CSI).
* Field testing host: conventional laptop running OS Ubuntu 18.04, no ROS installed.
  Running as a sudoer user.
* Remote Host: any conventional server running OS Ubuntu 18.04 with ROS 2 Crystal.
* CI host: any conventional server running OS Ubuntu 18.04.

* WLAN: a wifi local area network without security enabled, open for anyone to
  connect
* Corporate private network: a secure corporate wide-area network, that spans multiple cities.
  Only authenticated user with suitable credentials can connect to the network, and good security
  practices like password rotation are in place.

##### Processes

* Onboard TurtleBot3 Raspberry Pi
  * `turtlebot3_node`
  * CloudWatch nodes (hypothetical as it has not been yet ported to ROS 2)
    * `cloudwatch_metrics_collector`: subscribes to a the /metrics topic where
      other nodes publish MetricList messages that specify CloudWatch
      metrics data, and sends the corresponding metric data to CloudWatch
      metrics using the PutMetricsData API.
    * `cloudwatch_logger`: subscribes to a configured list of topics, and
      publishes all messages found in that topic to a configured log group
      and log stream, using the CloudWatch metrics API.
  * Monitoring Nodes
    * `monitor_speed`: subscribes to the topic /odom, and for each received
      odometry message, extract the linear and angular speed, build a
      MetricList message with those values, and publishes that message to
      data to the /metrics topic.
    * `health_metric_collector`: collects system metrics (free RAM, total RAM,
      total CPU usage, per core CPU usage, uptime, number of processes) and
      publishes it as a MetricList message to the /metrics topic.
  * [`raspicam2_node`][raspicam2_node] a node publishing Raspberry Pi Camera
    Module data to ROS 2.
* An XRCE Agent runs on the Raspberry, and is used by a DDS-XRCE client running
  on the [OpenCR 1.0 board][opencr_1_0], that publishes IMU sensor data to ROS
  topics, and controls the wheels of the TurtleBot based on the
  [teleoperation][tb3_teleop] messages published as ROS topics.
  This channel uses serial communication.
* A Lidar driver process running on the Raspberry interfaces with the Lidar, and
  uses a DDS-XRCE client to publish data over UDP to an XRCE agent also running on
  the Raspberry Pi.
  The agent sends the sensor data to several ROS topics.
* An SSH client process is running in the field testing host, connecting to the
  Raspberry PI for diagnostic and debugging.
* A software update agent process is running on the Raspberry PI, OpenCR board,
  and navigation hosts.
  The agent polls for updates a code deployment service process running on the CI host, that
  responds with a list of packages and versions, and a new version of each package when an update
  is required.
* The CI pipeline process on the CI host is a Jenkins instance that is polling a code repository
  for new revisions of a number of ROS packages.
  Each time a new revision is detected it rebuilds all the affected packages, packs the binary
  artifacts into several deployment packages, and eventually sends the package
  updates to the update agent when polled.

##### Software Dependencies

* OS / Kernel
  * Ubuntu 18.04
* Software
  * ROS 2 Core Libraries
  * ROS 2 Nodes: [`joy_node`][joy_node], [`turtlebot3_node`][turtlebot3_node],
    [`rospicam2_node`][raspicam2_node], [`teleop_twist_joy`][teleop_twist_joy]
  * ROS 2 system dependencies as defined by rosdep:
    * RMW implementation: we assume the RMW implementation is
      [`rmw_fastrtps`][rmw_fastrtps].
    * The threat model describes attack with the security enabled or disabled.
      If the security is enabled, [the security plugins][fastrtps_security] are assumed to be
      configured and enabled.

See [TurtleBot3 ROS 2 setup][tb3_ros2_setup] instructions for details about TurtleBot3 software
dependencies.

##### External Actors

* A user operates the robot with the joystick.
* A business analysts periodically checks dashboards with performance
  information for the robot in the AWS Cloudwatch web console.

##### Robot Data Assets

* Topic Message
  * Private Data
    * Camera image messages
    * Logging messages (might describe camera data)
    * CloudWatch metrics and logs messages (could contain Intellectual
      Property such as which algorithms are implemented in a particular
      node).
      * Restricted Data
    * Robot Speed and Orientation.
      Some understanding of the current robot task may be reconstructed from those messages..
* AWS CloudWatch data
  * Metrics, logs, and aggregated dashboard are all private data, as they
    are different serializations of the corresponding topics.
* Raspberry Pi System and ROS logs on Raspberry PI
  * Private data just like CloudWatch logs.
* AWS credentials on all hosts
  * Secret data, provide access to APIs and other compute assets on the AWS
    cloud.
* SSH credentials on all hosts
  * Secret data, provide access to other hosts.
* Robot embedded algorithm (e.g. `teleop_twist_joy`)
  * Secret data.
    Intellectual Property (IP) theft is a critical issue for nodes which are either easy to
    decompile or written in an interpreted language.

##### Robot Compute Assets

* AWS CloudWatch APIs and all other AWS resources accessible from the AWS
  credentials present in all the hosts.
* Robot Topics
  * `/cmd_vel` could be abused to damage the robot or hurt users.

#### Entry points

* Communication Channels
  * DDS / ROS Topics
    * Topics can be listened or written to by any actor:
      1. Connected to a network where DDS packets are routed to,
      1. Have necessary permissions (read / write) if SROS is enabled.
    * When SROS is enabled, attackers may try to compromise the CA authority
      or the private keys to generate or intercept private keys as well as
      emitting malicious certificates to allow spoofing.
    * USB connection is used for communication between Raspberry Pi and OpenCR board
      and LIDAR sensor.
  * SSH
    * SSH access is possible to anyone on the same LAN or WAN (if port-forwarding is enabled).
      Many images are setup with a default username and password with administrative
      capabilities (e.g. sudoer).
    * SSH access can be compromised by modifying the robot
* Deployed Software
  * ROS nodes are compiled either by a third-party (OSRF build-farm) or by the application
    developer.
    It can be compiled directly on the robot or copied from a developer workstation using scp or
    rsync.
  * An attacker compromising the build-farm or the developer workstation could
    introduce a vulnerability in a binary which would then be deployed to the
    robot.
* Data Store (local filesystem)
  * Robot Data
    * System and ROS logs are stored on the Raspberry Pi filesystem.
    * Robot system is subject to physical attack (physically removing the
      disk from the robot to read its data).
  * Remote Host Data
    * Machines running additional ROS nodes will also contain log files.
    * Remote hosts is subject to physical attack.
      Additionally, this host may not be as secured as the robot host.
  * Cloud Data
    * AWS CloudWatch data is accessible from public AWS API endpoints, if
      credentials are available for the corresponding AWS account.
    * AWS CloudWatch can be credentials can allow attackers to access other
      cloud ressources depending on how the account has been configured.
  * Secret Management
    * DDS / ROS Topics
      * If SROS is enabled, private keys are stored on the local filesystem.
    * SSH
      * SSH credentials are stored on the robot filesystem.
      * Private SSH keys are stored in any computer allowed to log into the
        robot where public/private keys are relied on for authentication
        purposes.
    * AWS Credentials
      * AWS credentials are stored on the robot file system.

#### Use case scenarios

* Development, Testing and Validation
  * An engineer develops code or run tests on the robot.
    They may:
    * Restart the robot
    * Restart the ROS graph
    * Physically interact with the robot
    * Log into the robot using SSH
    * Check AWS console for metrics and log
* End-User
  * A user tele-operates the robot.
    They may:
    * Start the robot.
    * Control the joystick.
  * A business analyst may access AWS CloudWatch data on the console to assess
    the robot performance.

#### Threat model

Each generic threat described in the previous section can be instantiated on
the TurtleBot 3.

This table indicates which TurtleBot particular assets and entry points are
impacted by each threat.
A check sign (✓) means impacted while a cross sign (✘) means not impacted.
The "SROS Enabled?" column explicitly states out whether using SROS would
mitigate the threat or not.
A check sign (✓) means that the threat could be exploited while SROS is enabled while a cross
sign (✘) means that the threat requires SROS to be disabled to be applicable.

### Threat Model Validation Strategy

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
Validating this threat model end-to-end is a long-term effort meant to be
distributed among the whole ROS 2 community.
The threats list is made to evolve with this document and additional reference may be introduced in
the future.
</div>

1. Setup a TurtleBot with the exact software described in the TurtleBot3 section
   of this document.
1. Penetration Testing
 * Attacks described in the spreadsheet should be implemented.
   For instance, a malicious <code>joy_node</code> could be implemented to try to
   disrupt the robot operations.
  * Once the vulnerability has been exploited, the exploit should be released
    to the community so that the results can be reproduced.
  * Whether the attack has been successful or not, this document should be
    updated accordingly.
  * If the attack was successful, a mitigation strategy should be implemented.
    It can either be done through improving ROS 2 core packages or it can be
    a platform-specific solution.
    In the second case, the mitigation will serve as an example to publish best practices for the
    development of secure robotic applications.

Over time, new reference platforms may be introduced in addition to
the TurtleBot 3 to define new attacks and allow other types of mitigations
to be evaluated.

## Threat Analysis for the `MARA` Robotic Platform

### System description

The application considered in this section is a **[MARA][mara_robot] modular robot operating on
an industrial environment while performing a pick & place activity**.
MARA is the first robot to run ROS 2 natively.
It is an industrial-grade collaborative robotic arm which runs ROS 2 on each joint, end-effector,
external sensor or even on its industrial controller.
Throughout the H-ROS communication bus, MARA is empowered with new possibilities in the
professional landscape of robotics.
It offers millisecond-level distributed bounded latencies for usual payloads and
submicrosecond-level synchronization capabilities across ROS 2 components.

Built out of individual modules that natively run on ROS 2, MARA can be physically extended in a
seamless manner.
However, this also moves towards more networked robots and production environments which brings
new challenges, especially in terms of [security and safety][safe_sec].

The robot considered is a [MARA][mara_datasheet], a 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) modular and
collaborative robotic arm with 3 kg of payload and repeatibility below 0.1 mm.
The robot can reach angular speeds up to 90º/second and has a reach of 656 mm.
The robot contains a variety of sensors on each joint and can be controlled from any industrial
controller that supports ROS 2 and uses the [HRIM][hrim] information model.
Each of the modules contains the [H-ROS communication bus][hros] for robots enabled by
the [H-ROS SoM][hrossom], which delivers real-time, security and safety capabilities for
ROS 2 at the module level.

No information is provided about how ROS 2 nodes are distributed on each module.
Each joint offers the following ROS 2 API capabilities as described in
their [documentation (MARA joint)][mara_joint_ros2_api]:

* **Topics**
  * `GoalRotaryServo.msg` model allows to control the position, velocity or/and effort (generated from [models/actuator/servo/topics/goal.xml](https://github.com/AcutronicRobotics/HRIM/blob/master/models/actuator/servo/topics/goal.xml), see [HRIM][hrim] for more).
  * `StateRotaryServo.msg` publishes the status of the motor.
  * `Power.msg` publishes the power consumption.
  * `Status.msg`  informs about the resources that are consumed by the H-ROS SoM,
  * `StateCommunication.msg` is created to inform about the state of the device network.

* **Services**
  * `ID.srv` publishes the general identity of the component.
  * `Simulation3D.srv` and `SimulationURDF.srv` send the URDF and the 3D model of the modular component.
  * `SpecsCommunication.srv` is a HRIM service which reports the specs of the device network.
  * `SpecsRotaryServo.srv` is a HRIM message which reports the main features of the device.
  * `EnableDisable.srv` disables or enables the servo motor.
  * `ClearFault.srv` sends a request to clear any fault in the servo motor.
  * `Stop.srv` requests to stop any ongoing movement.
  * `OpenCloseBrake.srv` opens or closes the servo motor brake.

* **Actions**:
  * `GoalJointTrajectory` allows to move the joint using a trajectory msg.

Such API gets translated into the following abstractions:

##### Network

1. **Ethernet time sensitive (TSN) internal network**: Interconnection of modular joints in the
  MARA Robot is performed over a daisy chained Ethernet TSN channel.
  Each module acts as a switch, forming the internal network of the robot.
1. **Manufacturer (Acutronic Robotics) corporate private network**: A secure corporate wide-area
 network, that spans multiple cities.
 Only authenticated user with suitable credentials can connect to the network, and good security
 practices like password rotation are in place.
 This network is used to develop and deploy updates in the robotic systems.
 Managed by the original manufacturer.
1. **End-user corporate private network**: A secure corporate wide-area network, that spans
 multiple cities.
 Only authenticated user with suitable credentials can connect to the network, and good security
 practices like password rotation are in place.
1. **Cloud network**: A VPC network residing in a public cloud platform, containing multiple
  servers.
  The network follows good security practices, like implementation of security applicances,
  user password rotation and multi-factor authentication.
  Only allowed users can access the network.
  The OTA service is open to the internet.
  Uses of the cloud network:
  * Manufacturer (Acutronic Robotics) uploads OTA artifacts from their
    `Manufacturer corporate private network` to the Cloud Network.
  * Robotic Systems on the `End-user corporate private network` fetch those artifacts from the
    Cloud Network.
  * Robotic Systems on the  `End-user corporate private network` send telemetry data for
    predictive maintenance to Cloud Network.

##### Software processes

In this section all the processes running on the robotic system in scope are detailed.

* **Onboard Modular Joints**
  * `hros_servomotor_hans_lifecyle_node` this node is in charge of controlling the motors inside
    the H-ROS SoM.
    This nodes exposes some services, actions and topics described below.
    This node publishes joint states, joint velocities and joint efforts.
    It provides a topic for servoing the modular joint and an action that will be waiting for a
    trajectory.
  * `hros_servomotor_hans_generic_node` a node which contains several generic services and topics
    with information about the modular joint, such as `power` measurement readings: voltage and
    current, `status` about the H-ROS SoM like cpu load or network stats, specifications about
    `communication` and `cpu`, the `URDF` or even the mesh file of the modular joint.
  * Mender (OTA client) runs inside the H-ROS SoM.
    When an update is launched, the client downloads this version and it gets installed and
    available when the device is rebooted.
* **Onboard Modular Gripper**: *Undisclosed*.
* **Onboard Industrial PC**:
  * MoveIt! motion planning framework.
  * Manufacturing process control applications.
  * Robot teleoperation utilities.
  * **ROS 1 / ROS 2 bridges**: These bridges are needed to be able to run MoveIT! which is not yet
    ported to ROS 2. Right now there is an
    [effort in the community](https://acutronicrobotics.com/news/ros-2-moveit-robotic-motion-planning/)
    to port this tool to ROS 2.

##### Software dependencies

In this section all the relevant third party software dependencies used within the different
components among the scope of this threat model are listed.

* Linux OS / Kernel

#### Use case scenarios

As described above, the application considered is a MARA modular robot operating on an industrial
environment while performing a `pick & place` activity.
For this use case all possible external actor have been included.
The actions they can perform on the robotic system have been limited to the following ones:

* **End-Users**: From the End-user perspective, the functions considered are the ones needed for
  a factory line to work.
  Among this functions, there are the ones keeping the robot working and being productive.
  On an industrial environment, this group of external actors are the ones making use of the robot
  on their facilities.
  * **Robotics Researcher**: Development, testing and validation
    * A research engineer develops a pick and place task with the robot.
      They may:
      * Restart the robot
      * Restart the ROS graph
      * Physically interact with the robot
      * Receive software updates from OTA
      * Check for updates
      * Configure ORC control functionalities
  * **Robotic User**: Collaborative tasks
    * Start the robot
    * Control the robot
    * Work alongside the robot
  * **Robotics Operator**: Automation of industrial tasks
    * An industrial operator uses the robot in a factory.
      They may:
      * Start the robot
      * Control the robot
      * Configure the robot
      * Include the robot into the industrial network
      * Check for updates
      * Configure and interact with the ORC
* **Manufacturer**: From the manufacturer perspective, the application considered is the
  development of the MARA robotic platform, using an automated system for deployment of updates,
  following a CI/CD system.
  These are the actors who create and maintain the robotic system itself.
  * **Robotics Engineer**: Development, testing and validation
    * Development of new functionality and improvements for the MARA robot.
      * Develop new software for the H-ROS SoM
      * Update OS and system libraries
      * Update ROS 2 subsystem and control nodes
      * Deployment of new updates to the robots and management of the fleet
      * In-Place robot maintenance

#### Entry points

The following section outlines the possible entry points an attacker could use as attack vectors
to render the MARA vulnerable.

* **Physical Channels**
  * Exposed debug ports.
  * Internal field bus.
  * Hidden development test points.
* **Communication Channels**
  * DDS / ROS 2 Topics
    * Topics can be listened or written to by any actor:
      1. Connected to a network where DDS packets are routed to.
      1. Have necessary permissions (read / write) if SROS is enabled.
    * When SROS is enabled, attackers may try to compromise the CA authority or the private keys
      to generate or intercept private keys as well as emitting malicious certificates to allow
      spoofing.
  * H-ROS API
    * H-ROS API access is possible to anyone on the same LAN or WAN (if port forwarding is enabled).
    * When authentication (in the H-ROS API) is enabled, attackers may try to vulnerate it.
  * Mender OTA
    * Updates are pushed from the server.
    * Updates could be intercepted and modified before reaching the robot.
* **Deployed Software**
  * ROS nodes running on hardware are compiled by the manufacturer and deployed directly.
    An attacker may tamper the software running in the hardware by compromising the OTA services.
  * An attacker compromising the developer workstation could
    introduce a vulnerability in a binary which would then be deployed to the
    robot.
  * MoveIt! motion planning library may contain exploitable vulnerabilities.

#### Trust Boundaries for MARA in `pick & place` application

The following content will apply the threat model to an industrial robot on its environment.
The objective on this threat analysis is to identify the attack vectors for the MARA robotic
platform.
Those attack vectors will be identified and clasified depending on the risk and services implied.
On the next sections MARA's components and risks will be detailed thoroughly using the threat
model above, based on STRIDE and DREAD.

The diagram below illustrates MARA's application with different trust zones (trust boundaries
showed with dashed green lines).
The number and scope of trust zones is depending on the infrastructure behind.

![Robot System Threat Model](ros2_threat_model/threat_model_mara.png)
[Diagram Source](ros2_threat_model/threat_model_mara.xml)
(edited with [Draw.io](draw_io))

The trust zones ilustrated above are the following:

* **Firmware Updates:** This zone is where the manufacturer develops the different firmware versions for each robot.
* **OTA System:** This zone is where the firmwares are stored for the robots to download.
* **MARA Robot:** All the robots' componentents and internal comunications are gathered in this zone.
* **Industrial PC (ORC):** The industrial PC itself is been considered a zone itself because it manages the software the end-user develops and sends it to the robot.
* **Software control:** This zone is where the end user develops software for the robot where the tasks to be performed are defined.

### Threat Model

Each generic threat described in the main threat table can be instantiated on the MARA.

This table indicates which of MARA's particular assets and entry points are
impacted by each threat.
A check sign (✓) means impacted while a cross sign (✘) means not impacted.
The "SROS Enabled?" column explicitly states out whether using SROS would mitigate the threat or
not.
A check sign (✓) means that the threat could be exploited while SROS is enabled while a
cross sign (✘) means that the threat requires SROS to be disabled to be applicable.

#### Attack Trees

In an atempt to analyze the different possible attacks before even happening, attack trees are
created.
This diagrams speculate about the possible attacks against the system in order to be able to
counter them.
Threats can be organized in the following [attack trees][wikipedia_attack_tree].
Attacks are ordered starting from the physical attack vector, continuing with network based
attacks, and finishing with the support infrastructure for the robot.

#### Physical vector attack tree

The following attack tree describes the possible paths to be followed by an attacker for
compromising the system.

The next diagram shows the infrastructure affected on a possible attack based on a compromise
of a physical communication port.

### Threat Model Validation Strategy

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
Validating this threat model end-to-end is a long-term effort meant to be distributed among
the whole ROS 2 community.
The threats list is made to evolve with this document and additional reference may be introduced
in the future.
</div>

1. Setup a MARA with the exact software described in the Components MARA section
   of this document.
1. Penetration Testing
  * Attacks described in the spreadsheet should be implemented.
    For instance, a malicious <code>hros_actuator_servomotor_XXXXXXXXXXXX</code> could be
    implemented to try to disrupt the robot operations.
  * Once the vulnerability has been exploited, the exploit should be released to the community
    so that the results can be reproduced.
  * Whether the attack has been successful or not, this document should be updated accordingly.
  * If the attack was successful, a mitigation strategy should be implemented.
    It can either be done through improving ROS 2 core packages or it can be a
    platform-specific solution.
    In the second case, the mitigation will serve as an example to publish best practices for
    the development of secure robotic applications.
  * For trainning purposes, an online playground ([RCTF][rctf]) exists to challenge
    roboticists to learn and discover robot vulnerabilities.
  * For an overall evaluation of the robots' security measures, the Robot Security
    Framework ([RSF][rsf]) will be used.
    This validation has to be don e after the assessment is completed in order to have a
    realistic results.

### Security Assessment preliminary results

Due to the iterative nature of this process, the results shown on this section may differ
depending on the threat model's version.

The results here presented are a summary of the discoveries made during the Acutronic
Robotics' MARA assessment.
Prior to the assessment, in order to be time-effective, a threat analysis was done over the
system and the most likely attack vectors were identified.

#### Introduction

Based on the threat model performed over MARA, an assessment has been performed in order to
discover the vulnerabilities within.
The content below is directly related to that threat model using all the attack vectors
identified as starting points for the exercise.

This Security Assessment Report for Acutronic Robotics’ MARA components has been performed by
Alias Robotics S.L.
The targeted system for the assessment is the H-ROS powered MARA.
H-ROS, the Hardware Robot Operating System, is a collection of hardware and software
specifications and implementations that allows creating modular and distributed robot parts.
H-ROS heavily relies on the use of ROS 2 as a robotic development framework.

This document presents an overview of the results obtained in the assessment.
In it, we introduce a report focused on identifying security issues or vulnerabilities detected
during the exercise.

#### Results

This assessment has evaluated the security measures present in the H-ROS SoM components.
The evaluation has been done through a vulnerability and risk assessment, and the following
sections are a summary of the findings.

The vulnerabilities are rated on a severity scale according to the guidelines stated in the
Robot Vulnerability Scoring System ([RVSS][rvss]), resulting in a score between 0 and 10,
according to the severity of the vulnerability.
The RVSS follows the same principles as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS),
yet adding aspects related to robotics systems that are required to capture the complexity of
robot vulnerabilities.
Every evaluated aspect is defined in a vector, having its weight at the final score.

All assessment findings from the MARA are classified by technical severity.
The following list explains how Alias Robotics rates vulnerabilities by their severity.

* **Critical**: Scores between 9 and 10
* **High**: Scores between 7 and 8.9
* **Medium**: Scores between 4 and 6.9
* **Low**: Scores between 0.1 and 3.9
* **Informational**: Scores 0.0

![Signing Service Mitigation](ros2_threat_model/vulns.png)

In the course of a first funded vulnerability assessment,
<a style="color:black;">**2 critical**</a>, <a style="color:red;">**6 high**</a>,
<a style="color:orange;">**13 medium**</a> and <a style="color:green;">**6 low**</a>
vulnerabilities have been found.
The ones fixed by Acutronic Robotics are disclosed below using the following format:
